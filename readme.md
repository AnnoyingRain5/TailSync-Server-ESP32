# TailSync Server (esp32)

NOTICE: THIS PROJECT IS IN A VERY EARLY STAGE, EXPECT BUGS AND RAPID UNVERSIONED PROTOCOL CHANGES, **DO NOT DEPLOY!!!**

Note: unlike the client code, you are expected to deploy this as-is, instead of basing your own code off of it.
I recommend using a python script to send commands to the server over USB serial.

## What?

TailSync is a protocol to allow event AV teams to control fursuit lighting. This is the server code, in other words, the code that the AV desk runs!


## How?

Info is in the client repo

## Why?

Becuase I can.
